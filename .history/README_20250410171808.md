This repository is a group of beginner projects using Tensor Flow. It's primary goal is to get me aquainted with basic machine learning, tensors and vectors. 

#Projects 
1. Hello TensorFlow (Basic Math Ops)
Goal: Learn how to use TensorFlow to add, multiply, and create constants/tensors.

Skills: Tensor creation, tf.constant, tf.Variable

2. Linear Regression (Predict Housing Prices)
Goal: Train a linear model to predict house prices based on square footage.

Skills: tf.keras.Sequential, loss functions, optimizers.

3. Handwritten Digit Classifier (MNIST Dataset)
Goal: Classify digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset using a dense neural network.

Skills: Dense layers, relu, softmax, one-hot encoding, accuracy evaluation.

4. Image Classification with CNN (Fashion MNIST)
Goal: Build a convolutional neural network to classify images of clothes.

Skills: Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flattening, dropout.

5. Binary Classification (Spam vs. Ham)
Goal: Use a small text dataset to classify SMS messages as spam or not.

Skills: Text vectorization, binary classification, sigmoid activation.

6. Time Series Forecasting (Stock Prices)
Goal: Predict future stock prices using past prices.

Skills: LSTM/RNN, time windowing, sequence prediction.

7. Image Generator with GAN (Toy Example)
Goal: Use a small GAN model to generate synthetic digits or simple patterns.

Skills: Generator/discriminator networks, adversarial training.

8. Transfer Learning (Cats vs. Dogs Classifier)
Goal: Use a pre-trained model like MobileNet or VGG16 and fine-tune it.

Skills: Feature extraction, frozen layers, custom classification heads.

9. Custom Loss Function (Robust Regression)
Goal: Train a model using your own loss function (like Huber loss).

Skills: Custom tf.keras.losses.Loss, understanding model.fit internals.

10. Interactive Dashboard with TensorBoard
Goal: Track training metrics visually with TensorBoard.

Skills: Logging, scalars, histograms, comparing runs.
