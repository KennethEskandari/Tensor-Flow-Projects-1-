#Explanation

    "In TensorFlow, data is divided into 3 main categories: Scalars, Vectors, and Matrices."
    "Scalars are single values, Vectors are 1D arrays, and Matrices are 2D arrays."
      )

#Scalar 
scalar = tf.constant(1)

#Vector
vector = tf.constant([1,10])


#Matrix
matrix = tf.constant([[1,10],[2,20]])
